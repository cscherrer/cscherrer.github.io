      <description>Say there&#39;s some experiment that generates noisy data. You and I each go through the process independently, and model the results. Would the resulting models be exactly the same?
Well no, of course not. That&#39;s the whole problem with noise. Instead, we&#39;ll usually end up with something like this (for a quadratic fit):

The idea is that we&#39;d like to find an approximation to \(f(x)\), but we can never observe this function directly.</description>

      <description>A client comes to you with this problem:
 The coal company I work for is trying to make mining safer. We made some change around 1900 that seemed to improve things, but the records are all archived. Tracking down such old records can be expensive, and it would help a lot if we could narrow the search. Can you tell us what year we should focus on?
Also, it would really help to know this is a real effect, and not just due to random variability - we don&#39;t want to waste resources digging up the records if there&#39;s not really anything there.</description>
